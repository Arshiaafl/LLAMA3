# LLaMA3-Based Chatbot with RAG Integration

Welcome to the **LLaMA3-Based Chatbot** repository! This project features a chatbot application built with the latest LLaMA3 model and enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for improved query handling. The app is designed to handle both specialized queries related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as well as general questions.

## Overview

The LLaMA3 model has been fine-tuned to provide accurate and relevant answers on LLM and NLP topics. However, the chatbot also offers the capability to respond to non-AI-related questions. To achieve this, the application uses RAG in conjunction with Elasticsearch to seamlessly integrate document-based and model-based responses.

### Key Features

- **Fine-Tuned LLaMA3 Model:** Tailored for high-quality responses on LLM and NLP questions.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enhances the chatbot’s ability to answer questions by leveraging external documents and the LLaMA3 model’s knowledge.
- **Elasticsearch Integration:** Facilitates efficient and accurate document retrieval to support the chatbot’s responses.
- **Dynamic Query Handling:** Automatically switches between document-based and model-based answers depending on the query context.

## Getting Started

To run the chatbot locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llama3-chatbot.git
    cd llama3-chatbot
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure Elasticsearch:**

    Ensure you have Elasticsearch running locally or set up on a server. Update the configuration in `config.py` with your Elasticsearch details.

4. **Run the Application:**

    Start the chatbot application:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

5. **Access the Chatbot:**

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the chatbot.

## Usage

You can ask the chatbot questions related to LLMs, NLP, or general queries. The chatbot will dynamically switch between document-based answers and LLaMA3 model responses based on the content of the question.
